## History and Independance
ToTeam was first started at the 19th of November in 2023 as a small sideproject and recoded in september 2025 on silverstripe to include new features such as a better database. 
There is no affiliation with toteam.app that launched in May 2025 with the same name and coded by AI. Other than that app, ToTeam tries to be independant, help organisations that don't have much money to organise their events and is coded by real people in their free time.

ToTeam is partly Open Source, so anyone can help creating the best tool for non-profit organisations with Pull Requests. We're working on making the whole project Open Source, but there is still a lot to consider and plan.

## Team
The project is initialized and run by Steffen Kahl from Germany
